=== The Concept

=== What is it?

*Spreadsheet-Handling* is a small, composable engine for turning data stored in tabular files
— such as JSON directories, CSVs, or Excel workbooks — into other structured forms.

It revolves around one central idea: **a pipeline of steps**.

Each *pipeline* describes a sequence of **steps**, and each *step* performs
one focused operation on a collection of tables (called *frames* in the code).

Typical examples of steps are:

* *validate* – check that required columns and formats are present
* *enrich* – derive or join additional columns (for example, foreign-key helpers)
* *export* – write the resulting tables to another backend (Excel, JSON, …)

The engine connects these steps through a simple data flow:

----
Input → [ Step 1: validate ] → [ Step 2: enrich ] → [ Step 3: export ] → Output
----


Every pipeline is defined in plain **YAML**,
so workflows can be version-controlled and easily reused.

==== Components in one sentence

|===
| Concept | Purpose
| **Step** | A single operation in the pipeline (e.g., validate, enrich, export).
| **Pipeline** | An ordered list of steps that defines *what happens* to the data.
| **Profile** | A named preset that defines *where data comes from and goes to* and which pipeline to run by default.
| **Config** | A YAML file containing multiple pipelines or profiles for a given project.
| **Shim** | A predefined CLI command (such as `sheets-pack` or `sheets-unpack`) that bundles a standard pipeline for quick use.
|===

==== Typical workflows

. **Quick use** – run one of the CLI shims such as `sheets-pack` or `sheets-unpack`
to convert between JSON and Excel without writing any YAML.

. **Ad-hoc pipeline** – describe your own list of steps in a small `steps.yml`
and execute it with
`sheets-run --steps steps.yml`.

. **Integrated repo setup** – in a data or project repository,
collect reusable pipelines and profiles in a shared `sheets.yaml`
and select one by
`sheets-run --config sheets.yaml --profile verify`.

Each option builds on the same underlying engine and allows you to scale from a single transformation to a complete set of managed workflows.
